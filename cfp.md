# PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit 2025 Call for Proposals (CFP)

We are excited to invite you to submit your session proposals for the **2025 PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit**, happening in Bellevue, WA April 7-10, 2025. The Summit is the premier event for PowerShell and DevOps professionals, where the community gathers to share knowledge, solve problems, socialize and network with peers, and push the boundaries of technology.

## What We're Looking For

This year, we are seeking a diverse range of topics focused on **PowerShell, DevOps, Cloud Computing, Automation**, and other relevant subjects. While we've seen amazing growth in PowerShell as a language, we are particularly interested in **new ways to use PowerShell and Automation integrations**, innovative problem-solving approaches, and fresh applications of existing tools. The topics we are interested in include, but are not limited to:

- **PowerShell**: Innovative use cases, advanced techniques, or novel approaches to automation with PowerShell.
- **Automation Integrations**: Using PowerShell to automate and integrate with other tools, platforms, or services such as Ansible, Terraform, IoT, etc.
- **DevOps Practices**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Infrastructure-as-Code, DevSecOps, and beyond.
- **Cross-Platform Automation**: Using PowerShell to manage Windows, Linux, and macOS environments.
- **Cloud Computing**: Using PowerShell in Azure, AWS, or other cloud environments, especially in the context of automation, management, or security.
- **Real-World Solutions**: Case studies, problem-solving approaches, and success stories demonstrating practical applications in the field.
- **Advanced Topics (400-level)**: We encourage deep-dive technical sessions for seasoned professionals. If you have a **400-level** session to propose, please clearly outline the advanced techniques or skills you will cover.
- **Security-Related Topics**: Sessions covering PowerShell security best practices, automation for security operations, securing DevOps pipelines, cloud security, and other emerging cybersecurity trends.
- **Soft Skills & Career Growth**: Talks that focus on career development, community-building, and professional growth within DevOps and IT communities.
- **Next-Level Sessions**: Any new and innovative approaches to PowerShell or DevOps that help solve problems. We especially want to hear the "Hey, no one talks about that" topics!

If you're unsure whether your idea fits, think: "Will this make the PowerShell/DevOps community better?" If the answer is yes or even a maybe, we want to hear from you.

### Session Types

We offer four types of sessions, each with associated speaker benefits. Please note that if there is more than one speaker, only the lead speaker is eligible for the honorarium and complimentary ticket:

- **Fast Focus (25-Minute Sessions)**: Short, focused talks designed to deliver one key idea or concept. Speakers must commit to delivering at least two Fast Focus sessions to qualify for speaker benefits. Each speaker will receive a **$250 honorarium**.
- **45-Minute Sessions**: Traditional sessions providing ample time to thoroughly cover a topic. Each speaker will receive a **$500 honorarium**.
- **90-Minute Deep Dives**: In-depth, workshop-style sessions for deeper exploration of a subject. Each speaker will receive a **$1,000 honorarium**.
- **4-Hour Hands-On Labs**: Extended, practical sessions where attendees can actively engage with the material. These interactive labs should include pre-prepared materials for participants to follow along. Each speaker will receive a **$2,000 honorarium**.

All sessions are required to be delivered in person at the conference site and, at a minimum, must be presented in English.

**The proposal submitter should secure the necessary permissions before submitting.**

We understand that some of you rely on your company to pay for travel to this event.  While we provide an honorarium, it is unlikely to cover all expenses, so if additional expenses are necessary, please start working on those details during the submission and review period.

In addition to the honorarium, speakers will receive a complimentary conference pass. However, please note that only one speaker per session will be eligible for these benefits. If you are co-presenting, benefits will only be extended to the primary speaker listed on the submission unless otherwise agreed upon in advance.

### Submission Process

We will be using a **two-round selection process**:

1. **Round 1 - Blind Review**: In the first round, we will conduct a blind review where submissions are anonymized. Each proposal will be rated on a Yes/No/Maybe scale.
2. **Round 2 - Comparison**: In the second round, proposals will be compared based on their scores, and final selections will be made.
 
We use a two-round selection process to ensure a fair and thorough review of all submissions, with the first round being blind to eliminate bias and focus solely on the quality and relevance of the content. This approach helps us select the best sessions based on merit before moving to a more detailed comparison in the second round.

### Important Information

We expect all speakers to **review the travel and speaker benefit information** outlined on the CFP page before submitting. Please ensure you are comfortable with the travel stipulations, especially if traveling internationally. There will be **no additional compensation** beyond what is clearly stated in the CFP.


- All sessions **must be delivered in person**. We do not accommodate remote or virtual presentations.
- Sessions **must be at a minimum delivered in English**.
- Speakers are expected to thoroughly review all conference details, including speaker benefits and session requirements, prior to submission.
