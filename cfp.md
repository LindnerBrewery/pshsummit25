# PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit 2025 Call for Proposals (CFP)

We are excited to invite you to submit your session proposals for the **2025 PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit**, happening in Bellevue, WA April 7-10, 2025. The Summit is the premier event for PowerShell and DevOps professionals, where the community gathers to share knowledge, solve problems, and push the boundaries of technology.

## What We’re Looking For

This year, we are seeking a diverse range of topics focused on **PowerShell, DevOps, Cloud Computing**, and other relevant subjects. While we’ve seen amazing growth in PowerShell as a language, we are particularly interested in **new ways to use PowerShell**, innovative problem-solving approaches, and fresh applications of existing tools. The topics we are interested in include, but are not limited to:

- **PowerShell Automation**: Innovative use cases, advanced techniques, or novel approaches to automation with PowerShell.
- **DevOps Practices**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Infrastructure-as-Code, DevSecOps, and beyond.
- **Cloud Computing**: Using PowerShell in Azure, AWS, or other cloud environments, especially in the context of automation, management, or security.
- **Real-World Solutions**: Case studies, problem-solving approaches, and success stories demonstrating practical applications in the field.
- **Advanced Topics (400-level)**: We encourage deep-dive technical sessions for seasoned professionals. If you have a **400-level** session to propose, please clearly outline the advanced techniques or skills you will cover.
- **Soft Skills & Career Growth**: We welcome talks that focus on career development, community-building, and professional growth within DevOps and IT communities.
- **Next-Level Sessions**: Any new approaches to PowerShell or DevOps that solve problems in innovative ways. We especially want to hear the "hey, no one talks about that" topics!

If you're unsure whether your idea fits, think: “Will this make the PowerShell/DevOps community better?” If the answer is yes, we want to hear from you.

### Session Types

We offer four types of sessions, each with associated speaker benefits. Please note that if there is more than one speaker, only the lead speaker is eligible for the honorarium and complimentary ticket:

- **Fast Focus (25-Minute Sessions)**: Short, focused talks designed to deliver one key idea or concept. Speakers must commit to delivering at least two Fast Focus sessions to qualify for speaker benefits. Each speaker will receive a **$250 honorarium**.
- **45-Minute Sessions**: Traditional sessions providing ample time to thoroughly cover a topic. Each speaker will receive a **$500 honorarium**.
- **90-Minute Deep Dives**: In-depth, workshop-style sessions for deeper exploration of a subject. Each speaker will receive a **$1,000 honorarium**.
- **4-Hour Hands-On Labs**: Extended, practical sessions where attendees can actively engage with the material. These interactive labs should include pre-prepared materials for participants to follow along. Each speaker will receive a **$2,000 honorarium**.

All sessions are delivered in person and must be conducted in English.

**The proposal submitter should begin to secure the necessary permissions before submitting.**

We understand that someof you rely on your company to pay for travel to this event.  While we provide an honorarium, it is unlikely to cover all T&L, so if additional expenses are necessary, please start working on those details during the submission and review period.


In addition to the honorarium, speakers will receive a complimentary conference pass. However, please note that only one speaker per session will be eligible for benefits. If you are co-presenting, benefits will only be extended to the primary speaker listed on the submission unless otherwise agreed upon in advance.

### Submission Process

We will be using a **two-round selection process**:

1. **Round 1 - Blind Review**: In the first round, we will conduct a blind review where submissions are anonymized. Each proposal will be rated on a Yes/No/Maybe scale.
2. **Round 2 - Comparison**: In the second round, proposals will be compared based on their scores, and final selections will be made.

### Important Information

We expect all speakers to **review the travel and speaker benefit information** outlined on the CFP page before submitting. Please ensure you are comfortable with the travel stipulations, especially if traveling internationally. There will be **no additional compensation** beyond what is clearly stated in the CFP.


- All sessions **must be delivered in person**. We do not accommodate remote or virtual presentations.
- Sessions **must be delivered in English**.
- Speakers are expected to thoroughly review all conference details, including speaker benefits and session requirements, prior to submission.
